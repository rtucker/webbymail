This is a script that accepts a mail (via your MTA's pipe functionality),
retrieves the URL given in the Subject:, and replies back with a collection
of that page's objects in MIME format.

This script is designed for cases where you have non-interactive Internet
access.  For example, if you're travelling and reading your RSS feeds while
out of Internet range, you can queue up e-mails of things that catch your
eye.

To use, add to your /etc/aliases or somewhere like that:
    webbymail: postmaster
    webbymail-asdfasdf: "!/home/rtucker/dev/webbymail/webbymail.py"

The webbymail alias is for any bounces that happen; the webbymail-asdfasdf
alias is for actual mail handling.  Note that this is slightly obfuscated
for some false level of security.

Also, you'll want to change the following stuff in webbymail.py:
    __ALLOWEDUSERS__
    __SENDER__
