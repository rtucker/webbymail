This is a script that accepts a mail (via your MTA's pipe functionality),
retrieves the URL given in the Subject:, and replies back with a collection
of that page's objects in MIME format.

This script is designed for cases where you have non-interactive Internet
access.  For example, if you're travelling and reading your RSS feeds while
out of Internet range, you can queue up e-mails of things that catch your
eye.
